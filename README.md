## Dictionary

This project is to demonstrate the understanding of how to use a collection of items that has an unique key and stores their own value.

The solution in steps
- add the item of key 1 twice 
- remove the item with the key of 3
- remove the item with the value of 9 then print 
- prints the value of 3 and 5
- sets a new int to be equal to the value of 3
- adds a new dictionary and sets it equal to the old dictionary
